# FPActivityIndicator
A simple activity indicator. Written in Swift. Simple and customisable from Interface builder and by code

#How to use it?

Just add FPActivityIndicator.swift to your project

Insert one UIView to your project in interface builder and change its class to FPActivityIndicator
You can define all the properties directly in IB without writing any code (using IBDesignable and IBInspectable)

If you are not a big fan of IB you can use this class directly in your code
